<h2> ⭐️ Implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (or LZW) algorithm in Java ⭐️ </h2>
<p> The LZW algorithm is a lossless data compression method that converts a sequence of characters into a binary code representation, which can be decoded back to the original sequence of characters. It achieves compression by replacing repeated sequences of characters with shorter codes.</p>
